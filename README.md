# Weatherpy

#Background

A Python script to visualize data points of the weather for 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. For this project, I utilized Python requests, the OpenWeatherMap API, and JSON traversals to create a series of maps to showcase the details of itenary.

#The script "WeatherPy"

    Randomly selects at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
    Performs a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
    Prints a log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
    Saves both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for itenary.
